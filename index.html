          <h1>About Me</h1>
          <p>I was a young girl who loved talking to people, asking questions, and hearing their stories. I would do my own talk show with friends where I would be the host and they would take on a character or celebrity identity, and I would interview them, talk about news, and the weather. I loved it!</p>
          <p>Even though I tended to be quiet in the classroom through my school years, I was comfortable to have a voice and be heard when it came time for a speech. I knew then, as I know now, this is my gift. I also knew when the time was right that I would use this gift for something good and with an admirable purpose.</p>
          <p>Now years later it is time to use my voice to share stories, inspire, and help others find happiness. My mission is to get people motivated to pursue a dream, do what they love, be passionate about life, and to help as many people as I can find their inner smile and truly be happy.</p>
